The simple interactive game. When the game starts, five faces are shown on the left and four are shown on the right. 
The left and right sides are identical, except for one thing: the left side has one extra face.
The user needs to click on that extra face. 
If anything except the correct face is clicked, a message is displayed saying that the game is over.
If the correct face is clicked, all the currently displayed faces are deleted and a new set of faces is shown at random positions.
Each time a new set of faces is shown there will be 5 more faces than before, on both the left and the right sides. 
There will always be one extra face shown on the left.
